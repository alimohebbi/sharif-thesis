Software developers notice existance of  faults by report of a fault issue tracking systems  or failure in software test. Then they try to locate bug and understanding the problem. Early detection of dault results in saving time and money and faciliates debugginh process. Prediction models can be built and used easly by modern statestical tools. Software metrics are the most important part of prediction models. Therfore higher perfomance in model can be achived using new and effective metrics. In this study, process metrics and metrics that built base on mutation analysis used and resulting models evaluted. In addition to using process metrics with mutation metrics, two group of metrics named \textit{mutation base process}  metrics and \textit{mutation-process hybrid} introduced for building prediction models. Results showed that can mutation metrics can improve prediction prefromance of process metrics. Although mutation base process metrics have a predective value, the can not perform better than mutation metrics. Also mutation-process hybrid metrics can improve performance in prediction models significantly.
