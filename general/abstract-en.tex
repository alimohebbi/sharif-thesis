Software developers notice existance of  faults by report of a fault in issue  tracking systems  or a failure in software tests. Then they try to locate the bug and understand the problem. Early detection of dault results in saving time and money and faciliates debugging process. Prediction models can be built and used easly by modern statestical tools. Software metrics are the most important part of prediction models. Therfore higher perfomance in models can be achived using new and effective metrics. In this study, process metrics and metrics that built base on mutation analysis used and resulting models evaluted. In addition to using process metrics with mutation metrics, two group of metrics named \textit{mutation base process}  metrics and \textit{mutation-process hybrid} introduced for building prediction models. Results showed that  mutation metrics can improve prediction prefromance of process metrics. Although mutation based process metrics have a predective value, they can not perform better than mutation metrics. Also mutation-process hybrid metrics can improve performance in prediction models significantly.
